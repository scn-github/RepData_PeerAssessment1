To student assessor:

As you will see, I have committed an .Rmd and .md file for assigment 1 to this repository.  As I am still new to GitHub (as well as R and knitr), I do not know how to committ the associated figures.  You should be able to use my .Rmd code in R Studio to re-create the figures as needed.

Thank you,

Steve N.
